A simple express wrapper around a clues API.  The `module.exports` is a function that returns an express route when given a custom API object as an argument.  Results for each API call are returned as a JSON string. 

Typical usage from a running express server would be as follows:
```
app.use('/apipath',require('express-clues')(api))
```

Two standard functions are added to the API:
### `multi`
The `multi` function returns multiple solved facts in one function call.  The list of required facts should be defined in the `data` parameter as a comma separated string.   An error in any of the required facts will not prevent other facts to be reported.

### `help`
Returns a list of the functions defined in the api
